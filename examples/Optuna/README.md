# PyTorch

Setup a virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
```
Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the code:
```
python3 simvue_optuna_pytorch.py
```
By default this will create a number runs in Simvue, all in a folder with name `/optuna/tests/<adjective>-<noun>`, where `<adjective>` is a random
adjective and `<noun>` is a random noun. Metadata and a metric `validation accuracy` is collected during each run. The metadata includes
an attribute `state` which indicates if the run completed successfully or was pruned.
