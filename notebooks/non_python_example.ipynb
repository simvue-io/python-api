    "# Example tracking a Non-Python Simulation\n",
    "This is an example of how you can use Simvue with Multiparser to track and monitor a non-Python simulation or other computational task. We will use a simple bash script to create some dummy 'temperature' data, looking at an experiment where the sample which is heated in an electric oven (causing its temperature to increase linearly), and then is taken out of the oven to cool down (losing temperature exponentially). We will then track this using the output file which is created during the experiment.\n",
