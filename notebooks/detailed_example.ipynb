    "# Detailed Example using Simpy\n",
    "This is a more detailed example of using Simvue to track and monitor a simulation. In this case we are going to use a package called Simpy to models a bank counter and customers arriving at random times. Each customer has a certain patience. They wait to get to the counter until they're at the end of their tether. If they get to the counter, they uses it for a while before releasing it for the next customer to use.\n",
